# Red-Lily

This is the beginning of a new era. A fully open source MMO that strives to deliver the ability to create and share your own worlds for free. No cash shops, no gimmicks, just volunteer work for an amazing game. Tons of niches to play and contribute and the ability to earn real cryptocurrency while you play. Everything is tradeable just like real life. In depth crafting systems allow players to develop skills in real life by learning from accredited experts in virtual reality. We are striving to create the worlds first FULL dive MMO.

Share a feeling, share the love, share the peace, and thank GOD above!
